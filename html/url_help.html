<h1>URL Editing</h1>

<p>The fields in this area allow you to construct the URL to
execute. The following are the major components of a URL:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Verb</dt>
<dd>The method to perform on the specified resource. The verbs (methods)
supported in the HTTP Client are: <ul>
<li><strong>GET</strong> - retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI.</li>
<li><strong>POST</strong> -  is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI.</li>
<li><strong>PUT</strong> - requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.</li>
<li><strong>DELETE</strong> - requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI.</li></ul></dd>
<dt>Protocol</dt>
<dd>The transmission protocol to use. The protocols supported in the HTTP Client
are: <ul>
<li><strong>http</strong> - A standard non-secured HTTP request</li>
<li><strong>https</strong> - A standard secured HTTP request</li></ul></dd>
<dt>Host:port</dt>
<dd>The host and service port of the server to call. You can specify a predefined
set of hosts/ports in the preferences page for HTTP Client for convenience, however
you can also just manually enter the host:port value desired.</dd>
<dt>URI</dt>
<dd>The resource URI to be accessed on the specified server. Once a successful call has 
been made to a URI, it will be placed in the drop-down for easy selection during the 
same session.</dd>
