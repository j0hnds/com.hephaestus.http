<h1>HTTP Request Data</h1>

<p>The fields in this area allow you to specify the data to be
sent with the request. The following tabs are available:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Bulk POST Data</dt>
<dd>This tab allows you to directly specify the content and content type
to be submitted with the POST or PUT methods. For example, if the server is
expecting an XML document as part of the POST or PUT, you would copy the content
of the XML document into the large text area and specify a content type
of <em>text/xml</em>.</dd>
<dt>POST Data</td>
<dd>This tab allows you to specify the name/value pairs for a standard form
POST request (as if you had submitted an HTML form). To insert a new element of
form data, right-click in the table and select <em>Insert</em>, then click on 
the column data to edit the value to be what you want.</dd>
<dt>File Upload</dt>
<dd>This tab allows you to specify the data as a multi-part file upload. Simply
browse to the path of the file to upload to the server. If the Upload field name
is not specified, the base name of the file will be used as the field name.</dd>
<dt>HTTP Headers</dt>
<dd>This tab allows you to specify the HTTP Headers to send with the request.
This table is editing in the same as as the POST Data tab above.</dd>
