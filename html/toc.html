<p>Welcome to the HTTPClient Plugin</p>
<p>This plugin provides a visual interface for invoking a variety of
different types of HTTP requests. It supports key HTTP verbs:

<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<li>POST</li>
<li>PUT</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it convenient to use as a test client for REST web services.</p>

<p>The plugin makes it easy to set up the data for POST/PUT calls. The data 
can be specified in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Form Post Data - This allows you to specify the data in terms of name-value
pairs and submitted as if you had posted a form.</li>
<li>Bulk Post Data - This allows you to specify the textual content of the
data to post along with a content-type specifying the type of data.</li>
<li>File Upload - This allows you to specify a file to upload with the POST.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further flexibility, you can specify the HTTP headers you wish to send
(above and beyond the standard HTTP headers).</>

<p>The plugin also provides <a href="importexport.html">import/export</a> functions to allow you to define the
calls you want to make, save them and restore them at a later time, saving you
precious time in setting up the call again.</p>
